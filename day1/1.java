Arithmetic Operators in Java
Instructions:

Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs arithmetic operations on them using the arithmetic operators (sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder) in Java.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n1=scanner.nextInt();
        int n2=scanner.nextInt();
        int sum=n1+n2;
        int diff=n1-n2;
        int prod=n1*n2;
        int quo=n1/n2;
        int rem=n1%n2;
        System.out.println("Sum: "+sum);
        System.out.println("Difference: "+diff);
        System.out.println("Product: "+prod);
        System.out.println("Quotient: "+quo);
        System.out.println("Remainder: "+rem);
        scanner.close();
    }
}
